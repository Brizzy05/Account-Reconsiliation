# Account-Reconsiliation
Given a csv of transactions states, 
in the transaction csv we can find:
- an account number
- an operation (withdraw or deposit)
- an amount
in the state scs we have
- an account number
- an amount

The program will analyse the transactions and compare them to the state of the account.
It returns a csv file containing the account with the actual amount and a decision.
